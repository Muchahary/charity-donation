# Transparent Charity Donation Project

## Vision
The Transparent Charity Donation Project aims to revolutionize the way donations are managed and distributed by providing a platform that ensures complete transparency and accountability. Our goal is to build trust between donors and charities by offering real-time tracking of donations, ensuring that every dollar goes exactly where it is intended.

## Features

- **Verified Charities**: Only verified and reputable charities can register on our platform, ensuring that funds are used responsibly.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed reports on how donations are spent, including administrative costs, are available to donors.
- **User Dashboard**: Donors have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view their donation history, set up recurring donations, and generate reports.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption ensures that all transactions and user data are secure.
